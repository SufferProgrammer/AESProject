AESProject is a simple GUI for start web server base on the SimpleHTTPServer and BaseHTTPServer, that was written to a script. 
This GUI mode is implemented 90% using PyQt4 modules, SimpleHTTPServer modules, and BaseHTTPServer modules that already include inside Python 2 or later except the PyQt4 modules.

# How To Use ?
You can type in your's console "git clone https://github.com/SweetClown/AESProject.git" and than go to folder config and run the configure.py.
configure.py is just python application that running installation PyQt4 modules and other element for make the gui.py run. if you're already installed PyQt4 module
